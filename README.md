# blog

I'm experimenting with starting a blog.

I want somewhere to put stuff i write and that i want to share more widely than work.

This could end up being a temporary solution, and i might end up using something more made-for-task. But for now i just want to focus on a simple system that supports writing rather than technical decisions. Also, i like GH's defaults when it comes to syntax highlighting and mermaid support so this will do for the time being.
