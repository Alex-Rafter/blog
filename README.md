# blog

I'm experimenting with starting a blog. I want somewhere to put stuff that i write and want to share.

This could very likley end up being a temporary solution,  and i might end up using something more made for the task of blogging. But for now i just want to use something simple that gets out of the way while i focus on writing to 'finished' (contrasted with the reams of unpolished notes i have lying about). Also, i like GH's defaults when it comes to syntax highlighting and mermaid support so this will do just fine for the time being.
